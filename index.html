            <h3 id="headline">Here's a Fredie Mercury biography:</h3>
            <p>Original name <strong>Farrokh Bulsara</strong>, (born September 5, 1946, Stone Town, Zanzibar - died
                November 24, 1991, Kensington, London, England), British rock singer and songwriter whose flamboyant
                showmanship and powerfully agile vocals, most famously for the band Queen, made him one of rock’s most
                dynamic front men.
            </p>
            <p>Influenced by the hard-edged blues-based style of rock acts such as Cream and Jimi Hendrix, Bulsara began
                singing with bands in London. He also became friends with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor
                of the band Smile, and in 1970, when Smile’s lead singer quit, Bulsara replaced him. He soon changed the
                group’s name to Queen and his own to Freddie Mercury. Bassist John Deacon joined the following year.
                Incorporating elements of both heavy metal and glam rock, the band debuted on record with Queen (1973),
                which was followed by Queen II (1974). Despite an impressive blend of majestic vocal harmonies and
                layered virtuosic guitar work, Queen initially failed to attract much notice beyond the United Kingdom.
                The album Sheer Heart Attack (1974), however, shot up the international charts, and A Night at the Opera
                (1975) sold even better. The band’s ambitious approach to both songwriting and studio production was
                epitomized by the latter album’s mock-operatic single “Bohemian Rhapsody,” one of a number of Queen
                compositions written principally by Mercury. The song spent nine weeks atop the British singles chart,
                and its accompanying promotional film helped the music industry recognize its future in video.
                Spectacular success followed in 1977 with “We Are the Champions” and “We Will Rock You”—which became
                ubiquitous anthems at sporting events in Britain and the United States.
            </p>
            <p>By the early 1980s Queen had become an international phenomenon, drawing particular attention for its
                elaborately staged performances in enormous venues. Strutting the stage in outrageous costumes, Mercury
                effortlessly commanded audiences in the tens of thousands. Although Queen’s commercial fortunes had
                begun to wane by mid-decade, the band arguably reached its apotheosis as a live act with a stellar
                performance at the charity concert Live Aid in 1985. That same year Mercury released the solo record Mr.
                Bad Guy, which took musical inspiration from disco. Mercury later appeared on the sound track of Dave
                Clark’s science-fiction musical Time (1986) and teamed with Spanish soprano Montserrat Caballé for the
                semi-operatic album Barcelona (1988).</p>
            <p>In 1991 Mercury announced that he had been diagnosed with AIDS. He died a day later from complications
                related to the disease. Until shortly before his death, Mercury had continued to record with Queen, and
                he was posthumously featured on the band’s final album, Made in Heaven (1995). His time with Queen was
                dramatized in the blockbuster film Bohemian Rhapsody (2018). Although Rami Malek won an Academy Award
                for his performance as Mercury in the movie, Bohemian Rhapsody was criticized for its sanitized
                presentation of Mercury’s complicated life, particularly his sexual fluidity.</p>
